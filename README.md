## About

Northstar is an open source embedded container runtime optimized for speed and
resource usage. Northstar combines several standard Linux process isolation and
sandboxing features to gain a medium level of isolation between
containers/processes. The Northstar runtime consists out of two parts: The
container handling and process spawning. To build the most efficient and robust
solution, Northstar is completely developed in Rust, a language designed to
afford the performance of C/C++ without their footguns.

### Containers

Northstar containers are called `NPK`. The NPK format is heavily inspired by the
[Android APEX](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/apex) technology. A
Northstar container contains:

* Root filesystem in a [Squashfs](https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools)
  file system image (optionally compressed)
* Northstar manifest with process configuration and container meta information

Northstar containers can be created with the Northstar utility
[sextant](tools/sextant/README.md).

### Processes

Started Northstar contains are Linux processes. The attributes and environment
for a spawned container is described in a container manifest which is included
in a NPK. The container manifest allows to configure the following Linux
subsystems and features:

* Arguments passed to the containers init
* Environment variables set in the container context
* User and group id
* Mount namespace
* PID namespace
* Cgroups memory (optional)
* CGroups CPU (optional)
* Additional bind mounts (optional)
* Capabilities (optional)
* Stdout/stderr handling (optional)
* Seccomp configuration (optional)

### Comparison

* Northstar containers are not portable and are tailored to a known system (uid/gid/mounts...)
* **TODO**

## Quickstart

Northstar is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). The minimum supported
Rust version (MSRV) is *1.56*. Rust is best installed and managed by the rustup
tool. Rust has a 6-week rapid release process and supports a great number of
platforms, so there are many builds of Rust available at any time. rustup
manages these builds in a consistent way on every platform that Rust supports,
enabling installation of Rust from the beta and nightly release channels as well
as support for additional cross-compilation targets.

Building Northstar is limited to Linux systems and runs on Linux systems **only**!
The Northstar build generates bindings for various system libraries and uses the
`mksquashfs` command line tool for NPK creation.

Install build dependencies on Debian based distributions by running

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential libclang1 squashfs-tools
```

The `squashfs-tools` are required in version **4.5** or higher.

Northstar comes with a set of [examples](./examples) that demonstrate most of
the Northstar features. Building the example binaries and packing its
corresponding NPKs is done via:

```sh
./examples/build_examples.sh
```

Building and starting the [example runtime main](./main/src/main.rs) is
triggered by a

```sh
cargo run --bin northstar
```

The Northstar workspace configuration configures a cargo
[runner](.cargo/runner-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) that invokes the runtimes
example main binary with super user rights.

Use the [nstar](./tools/nstar/README.md) utility to inspect and modify the
runtimes state e.g.

```sh
cargo build --release --bin nstar 
...
./target/release/nstar --help 
...
> ./target/release/nstar -j start hello-world
{"Response":{"Err":{"StartContainerStarted":{"name":"hello-world","version":"0.0.1"}}}}
> ./target/release/nstar -j kill hello-world
{"Response":{"Ok":null}}
```

## Configuration

The example executable `northstar` reads a configuration file that represents
`northstar::runtime::config::Config`.

```toml
# Directory where containers are mounted
run_dir = "target/northstar/run"
# Directory for `persist` mounts of containers
data_dir = "target/northstar/data"
# Log directory for debug logs and traces
log_dir = "target/northstar/logs"
# Top level cgroup name
cgroup = "northstar"

# Debug TCP console on localhost with full access
[consoles."tcp://localhost:4200"]
permissions = "full"

# Start a `strace -p PID ...` instance after a container is started.
# The execution of the application is deferred until strace is attached.
[debug.strace]
# Configure the output of the strace instance attached to a started
# application. "file" for a file named strace-<PID>-name.log or "log"
# to forward the strace output to the runtimes log.
output = "log"
# Optional additional flags passed to `strace`
flags = "-f -s 256"
# Optional path to the strace binary
path = /bin/strace
# Include the runtime system calls prior to exeve
include_runtime = true

# Start a `perf record -p PID -o LOG_DIR/perf-PID-NAME.perf FLAGS` instance
# after a container is started.
[debug.perf]
# Optional path to the perf binary
path = "/bin/perf"
# Optional additional flags passed to `perf`
flags = ""

# NPK Repository `memory` configuration. This is a not persistent in memory repository
[repositories.memory]
key = "examples/northstar.pub"
type = "mem"

# NPK Repository `default` in `dir`
[repositories.default]
# Mount the containers from this repository on runtime start. Default: false
mount = true
key = "examples/northstar.pub"
type = { fs = { dir = "target/northstar/repository" }}
```

### Repositories

**TODO**: Describe what a repository is and what are the attributes:
*with/without key/verity, etc...

## Console

Northstar uses **JSON** to encode the messages shared with clients. The messages
are newline delimited. This is a common approach that facilitates clients being
implemented in any programming language.  However, Northstar as a library,
provides a convenient
[Client](https://esrlabs.github.io/northstar/northstar/api/client/struct.Client.html)
type that can be used for a simpler client implementation using **Rust**.
Northstar interacts with clients through a `TCP` socket bound to each address
configured in `runtime::config::Config::console`.

* **TODO**: Move client guide part to a README-console.md etc
* **TODO**: Update guide/src/client/connect with the connect sequence.
* **TODO**: [Client API docs](https://esrlabs.github.io/northstar/northstar/index.html)

## Integration tests

Integration tests start a runtime instance and assert on log output of
container of notification sent from the runtime. The testsuite is invoked by the
Rust test system:

```sh
cargo test -p northstar-tests
```

and are executed by the project [CI](https://github.com/esrlabs/northstar/actions).

## Portability

Northstar makes extensive use of Linux Kernel features and runs on Linux systems
only. Northstar is tested on the architectures

* `aarch64-linux-android`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` aka `Linux Desktop`

Northstar cannot be run on 32 bit systems! In order to verify that all needed
Kernel features are available, either run the
[check_conf](./tools/check_conf.sh) script or manually compare the target's
kernel configuration with the `CONFIG_` entries in the `check_conf.sh` script.

**TODO**: List required `CONFIG_` items here. The check_confi script runs on
*Android only
