# Running the examples

To run the examples, you first need to create the `NPK`s for the architecture you plan to run them on.

In the toplevel rakefile we provide a task to build the `NPK`s for different target architectures.

Once you have the `*.npk` packages in your registry, you can start the northstar process and configure this registry.

When the northstar runtime is up and running, you can issue control commands to it via a socket.
We provide an utility that can easily communicate with the northstar daemon and send it commands (`nstar`)

Build `nstar` using the raketask `rake build:nstar`

After that just start `nstar` (found in `./target/release/nstar`). It is an interactive client that offers this help:

``` shell
➜  northstar git:(master) ✗ ./target/release/nstar
>> help
