# Working with NPK files

Northstar containers are distributed in the NPK file format.

NPKs contain both the container's application logic as well as the data files necessary to mount an run the container.
To facilitate the creation, inspection and modification of NPKs, northstar provides the `sextant` CLI tool.

The following chapters describe how to use `sextant` to work with NPKs and explain the internal structure of the NPK file format.
