# Implementing a client

This tutorial demonstrates how to interact with **Northstar** using its **API**.

**Northstar** uses **JSON** to encode the messages shared with clients. This is
a common approach that facilitates clients being implemented in any programming
language.  However, **Northstar** as a library, provides a convenient `Client`
type that can be used for a simpler client implementation using **Rust**.

For general purposes, the snippets shown in this tutorial are
written in **Python** for its simplicity and easy translation to other
languages.
